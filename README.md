# CrudAPI #
This project is in the very early stages of development.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taskforcedev/crud-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/taskforcedev/crud-api) [![Codacy Badge](https://www.codacy.com/project/badge/aff7a9540c4b4f03977393a05d23a25d)](https://www.codacy.com/public/taskforce2eu/crud-api)

The project provides a 'replacement' (extension) to the laravel Model class which allows users to extend this instead, this class requires a validate method as well as the laravel requirements, this allows the crud process to be automated based on the assumption that the validate method handles authorization and data validation.
